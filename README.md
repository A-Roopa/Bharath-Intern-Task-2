OVERVIEW OF PROJECT Project: Titanic Classification on Titanic DataSet

Objective:

The objective of the Titanic classification project is to predict passenger survival based on features such as age, gender, and ticket class. The goal is to build a reliable model to determine survival likelihood, analyze factors influencing survival rates, and serve as an educational example of data science and machine learning applications.

Key Activities:

Data Preprocessing: Clean the dataset by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing numerical features.
Feature Engineering: Create new features such as family size, extract titles from names, and generate binary indicators for specific characteristics.
Model Training and Evaluation: Train advanced models (e.g., Gradient Boosting, Random Forest), tune hyperparameters, and evaluate using cross-validation and classification reports.
Prediction and Interpretation: Predict survival with the best model, interpret feature importance using tools like SHAP, and visualize results.

Technology:

Programming Language: Python for its robust data science libraries and community support.
Libraries:
Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation and numerical operations.
Scikit-learn for model training, evaluation, and feature engineering.
Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization.
Algorithms: Gradient Boosting, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines for advanced model performance.
Tools: GridSearchCV and RandomizedSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning, and SHAP for model interpretation.

Outcomes:

Accurate Prediction Model: Developed a reliable model to predict passenger survival on the Titanic with high accuracy.
Feature Importance Insights: Identified and understood key factors influencing survival rates using tools like SHAP.
Enhanced Data Understanding: Improved data preprocessing and feature engineering techniques, leading to better model performance.
Educational Value: Demonstrated effective use of advanced machine learning techniques and tools for real-world classification problems.
